# PPUK Testing Guide

## Test User Accounts

To test the PPUK platform, you'll need to create test user accounts first. Here's how:

### Creating Test Users

1. **Create Test Owner Account:**
   - Go to `/register`
   - Email: `owner@ppuk.test`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Full Name: `Test Owner`
   - Role: `Property Owner`

2. **Create Test Buyer Account:**
   - Go to `/register`
   - Email: `buyer@ppuk.test`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Full Name: `Test Buyer`
   - Role: `Buyer`

### Quick Test Login

Once you've created these accounts, you can use the **Test Login** page (`/test-login`) for quick access:
