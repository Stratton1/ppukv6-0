-- Users can insert their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

```

#### Documents Table
```sql
-- Property owners can view documents

    SELECT 1 FROM properties
    WHERE properties.id = documents.property_id
    AND properties.claimed_by = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Property owners can insert documents
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can insert documents" ON documents FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM properties
    WHERE properties.id = documents.property_id
    AND properties.claimed_by = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Property owners can update documents
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can update documents" ON documents FOR UPDATE USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM properties
    WHERE properties.id = documents.property_id
    AND properties.claimed_by = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

#### Property Photos Table
```sql
-- Anyone can view photos of public properties
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view photos of public properties" ON property_photos FOR SELECT USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM properties
    WHERE properties.id = property_photos.property_id
    AND properties.is_public = TRUE
  )
);

-- Property owners can insert photos
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can insert photos" ON property_photos FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM properties
    WHERE properties.id = property_photos.property_id
    AND properties.claimed_by = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Property owners can delete photos
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can delete photos" ON property_photos FOR DELETE USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM properties
    WHERE properties.id = property_photos.property_id
    AND properties.claimed_by = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

#### Saved Properties Table
```sql
-- Users can view their saved properties
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their saved properties" ON saved_properties FOR SELECT USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Users can insert their saved properties
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their saved properties" ON saved_properties FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Users can delete their saved properties
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their saved properties" ON saved_properties FOR DELETE USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

## üìÅ Storage Configuration

### Storage Buckets Created
1. **`property-documents`** (private)
   - Secure document storage
   - Owner-only access policies
   - Folder structure: `/property_id/filename`

2. **`property-photos`** (public)
   - Public photo gallery
   - Anyone can view
   - Owner-only upload/delete

### Storage RLS Policies
```sql
-- Property documents (private)
CREATE POLICY "Property owners can view their documents" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'property-documents' 
  AND auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT claimed_by FROM properties 
    WHERE id::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
  )
);

-- Property photos (public)
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view property photos" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'property-photos');
```

## üöÄ Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Create .env file** with Supabase credentials
2. **Test database connection** with environment variables
3. **Run seeding scripts** to populate test data
4. **Verify RLS policies** with test user authentication

### Recommended Testing Sequence
```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env  # (create from template)
# Edit .env with actual Supabase credentials

# 2. Seed test users
SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... node scripts/seed-supabase-users.js

# 3. Seed properties
# Execute scripts/seed-dev-data.sql in Supabase SQL editor

# 4. Test authentication
# Visit /login and test with owner@ppuk.test / password123

# 5. Verify data access
# Check /dashboard and property listings
```

### System Health Indicators
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema:** Complete and properly structured
- ‚úÖ **Security Policies:** Comprehensive RLS implementation
- ‚úÖ **Seeding Scripts:** Multiple options available
- ‚úÖ **Storage Setup:** Buckets and policies configured
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Environment:** Needs .env configuration
- ‚ùì **Connection:** Requires testing with credentials
