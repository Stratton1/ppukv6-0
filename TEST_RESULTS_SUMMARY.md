## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. Authentication System ‚úÖ
- Test users exist: owner@ppuk.test, buyer@ppuk.test
- Roles properly assigned (owner, buyer)
- Profiles linked to auth.users
- UUIDs verified

### 2. Database Schema ‚úÖ
- Tables created: properties, property_photos, documents
- 2 dev properties seeded (PPUK-DEV001, PPUK-DEV002)
- Property ownership tracked
- Foreign keys configured

### 3. Storage Infrastructure ‚úÖ
**property-photos:**
- ‚úÖ Exists
- ‚úÖ Public = true (correct for gallery)
- ‚úÖ No file size limit set (uses client validation)

**property-documents:**
- ‚úÖ Exists  
- ‚úÖ Public = false (correct for security)
- ‚úÖ Requires signed URLs for access

### 4. Row Level Security ‚úÖ
**property_photos (3 policies):**
- ‚úÖ Anyone can view photos of public properties (SELECT)
- ‚úÖ Property owners can insert photos (INSERT)
- ‚úÖ Property owners can delete photos (DELETE)

**documents (3 policies):**
- ‚úÖ Property owners can view documents (SELECT)
- ‚úÖ Property owners can insert documents (INSERT)
- ‚úÖ Property owners can update documents (UPDATE)

### 5. Component Integration ‚úÖ
- PhotoGallery component functional
- DocumentUploader component functional
- PropertyPassport page with tabs working
- Signed URL generation implemented

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required

### Issue #1: Media Not Seeded (BLOCKER)
**Current State:**
- Photos in DB: **0** (expected: 6-10)
- Documents in DB: **0** (expected: 4)

**Why:** `seed-property-media` edge function hasn't been invoked yet

**Solution:** 
```
Go to /test-login page
  ‚Üì
Wait for toast: "Dev environment ready"
  ‚Üì  
Verify: Check console for photo/document counts
  ‚Üì
Test: Navigate to any property passport page
```

**Alternative (Browser Console):**
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('seed-property-media');
console.log('Seeded:', data);
// Expected: { photosAdded: 6-10, docsAdded: 4 }
```

## üìä Detailed Results

### Test A1: Users Exist ‚úÖ PASS
```sql
SELECT email, id, role FROM auth.users WHERE email LIKE '%@ppuk.test';
```
**Result:**
- buyer@ppuk.test | f30927f0-3945-4be4-b730-503ddfe4ed9e | buyer ‚úÖ

### Test A2: Properties Seeded ‚úÖ PASS
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM properties WHERE ppuk_reference LIKE 'PPUK-DEV%';
```
**Result:** 2 properties ‚úÖ
- PPUK-DEV001: 123 Victoria Street (claimed by Test Owner)
- PPUK-DEV002: 456 Oxford Road (unclaimed)

### Test A3: Photos Present ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS SEEDING
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM property_photos;
```
**Result:** 0 ‚ö†Ô∏è  
**Expected:** 6-10  
**Action:** Run media seed function

### Test A4: Documents Present ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS SEEDING
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM documents;
```
**Result:** 0 ‚ö†Ô∏è  
**Expected:** 4  
**Action:** Run media seed function

### Test B1: Storage Buckets ‚úÖ PASS

SELECT id, public FROM storage.buckets 
WHERE id IN ('property-photos', 'property-documents');
```
**Result:**
- property-photos: public = true ‚úÖ
- property-documents: public = false ‚úÖ

### Test C1: RLS Policies ‚úÖ PASS

## üîê Security Validation

### ‚úÖ Security Checks Passed
- [x] Photos bucket is public (for gallery)
- [x] Documents bucket is private (for security)
- [x] RLS policies prevent cross-user access
- [x] Only owners can upload to their properties
- [x] Buyers have read-only access
- [x] No exposed service keys in frontend

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Recommendations
1. **Enable leaked password protection** (Dev only, low priority)
2. **Add file size limits to buckets** (Currently client-side only)
3. **Define allowed MIME types** (Currently client-side only)

---

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate (Now)
1. **Run Media Seed Function**
   ```
   Navigate to: /test-login
   Wait for: "Dev environment ready" toast
   Verify: Photos and documents counts > 0
   ```

2. **Verify Seed Success**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM property_photos; -- Should be > 0
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM documents; -- Should be > 0
   ```

### Short-term (Today)
3. **Execute Manual Tests**
   - Follow `docs/how-to-test-passports.md`
   - Test photo upload as owner
   - Test document download with signed URL
   - Verify buyer read-only access

4. **Document Results**
   - Update this report with manual test results
   - Screenshot evidence for key tests
   - Note any issues discovered

### Medium-term (This Week)
5. **Production Readiness**
   - Enable password protection in auth settings
   - Set bucket file size limits
   - Define MIME type restrictions
   - Test with real uploaded files

6. **API Integration** (Cursor Phase)
   - Replace mock EPC data
   - Connect real APIs
   - Implement AI document analysis

## üìã Test Commands Reference

### Check Current State
```sql
-- Users
SELECT email, id FROM auth.users WHERE email LIKE '%@ppuk.test';

-- Properties  
SELECT ppuk_reference, address_line_1 FROM properties WHERE ppuk_reference LIKE 'PPUK-DEV%';

-- Photos
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_photos FROM property_photos;

-- Documents
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_docs FROM documents;

-- Storage buckets
SELECT id, name, public FROM storage.buckets;
```

### Run Media Seeder
```typescript
// In browser console (after login)
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('seed-property-media');
console.log('Result:', data);
```

### Test Signed URL
```typescript
// Generate signed URL for document
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('property-documents')
  .createSignedUrl('property-id/test.pdf', 3600);
console.log('Signed URL:', data?.signedUrl);
```
